# Uncommon Dart Error: Re-throwing Exceptions

This repository demonstrates a scenario involving exception handling in Dart.  The code showcases how to properly handle exceptions within asynchronous operations and how to re-throw exceptions for cascading error handling.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that simulates a network request failure. The error is caught, logged, and then re-thrown to enable higher-level functions to manage the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows the same example with a more refined error handling mechanism.
